# Fundamental questions in physics seminar

The "A fizika fundamentális kérdései szeminárium" / "Fundamental questions in physics seminar" is a __reading seminar__, not a lecture or practice. This means that the requirement is that you read litereture (book, articles) related to the topic and work out a shor essay (~3-5pages) and a presentation in which you summarize the reading material and present your reflections. 

It can be fulfilled in English or Hungarian. The reading material will be in English. The seminar will be held as a (depending on the number of students) one or two day workshop around second half of April. In the previous years we discussed Lee Smolin's "Time reborn" book, but as several years has passed, so there is a longer suggested list below. Further suggestions are welcome. 

### To get a mark, you will need to:
- select a topic and background literature -- related to foundations of physics, or sciences in general -- and present briefly your plans
- read the book/articles and present a summary and your reflections in a ~10-15 minute presentation. Also take part in discussion with questions comments to other's presentation.
- write an assay (~3-5 pages) on the selected topic that is  

In the coming weeks we will have a kick-off meeting where we finalize the reading material and assign the chapters.

### _Task for the kick-off meeting - February 23_
- look through the original seminar book and the other resources below
- check out related reviews, podcasts, etc.
- you may suggest other similar resources
- __Put together few slides:__
  - your reflection on the list of resources
  - pick something that you would be most interested, volunteer for seminar topic - also have idea on when to present
